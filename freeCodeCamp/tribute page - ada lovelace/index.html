                Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
                Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. As a result, she is often considered the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and the first computer programmer.
